# Why?

ev.io can run very bad on computers with with the default settings in chrome adding lots of latency due to vsync and some other chromium engine flaws.

# Shoutouts 

[Panda](https://github.com/PandasMagic/Comp-Client) -> The preload.js file which I've adapted for this client (exit button).

[MR2K](https://github.com/m2rk1312) -> Some client ideas, and some inspiration I got from working on his client project.

[Gama](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/community-patch-evio/ifoamcioafnhbhakboliekfopmefahip) -> His community patch fixes some big issues with the game, the extension has been obfuscated for his code's safety!
